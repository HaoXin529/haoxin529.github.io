Hi there! Thanks for visiting! I'm Ashley Hao, and this site shares my work on learning, attention, and developmental cognitive neurscience :)

### 🎓 Education & Training

I am currently pursuing my M.S. in **Cognitive Psychology** at **Vanderbilt University 🐿️ Peabody College**, working under the supervision of **Dr. Sophia Vinci-Booher** and **Dr. Gavin Price**. My master’s thesis examines number processing in ventral and dorsal cortices across early childhood using longitudinal fMRI data.  

Through this work, I aim to understand how **learning-driven neuroplasticity** and **attentional development** shape the functional architecture of the brain.

Before Vanderbilt, I received dual Bachelor’s degrees in **Neuroscience** and **Psychology** from **Syracuse University 🍊**. During my undergraduate years, I worked on projects involving **mindfulness-based interventions**, **EEG studies of attention**, and **stress-related psychophysiology**. This period fostered my early interest in how attention and learning emerge through experience and brain plasticity.

### 🧠 Research Interests

#### (1) Developmental trajectories of neuroplasticity
- Age-related changes in **functional lateralization, selectivity** and **white matter organization** that support symbolic learning (letters, numbers) and higher-order academic skills (reading, mathematics).
- Longitudinal mapping of **individual variability** in learning-related cortical reorganization  
- Linking **neural efficiency and flexibility** to cognitive growth and academic outcomes  

#### (2) Learning and attention development
- Neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying the emergence and development of **attentional control** in childhood  
- **Plasticity of attention networks** and how experience shapes functional connectivity between frontal and parietal regions
- How **attentional states** (e.g., sustained attention, mind-wandering) modulate **learning efficiency** and feedback-based updating during skill acquisition.

#### (3) Integrating developmental computational and neuroimaging approaches
- Using **model-based fMRI** and **multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)** to reveal representational changes during learning  
- Leveraging **developmentally informed machine learning** to predict trajectories of learning and cognitive control

### ✨ Broader Goal
Through this work, I aim to uncover **mechanistic principles of neuroplasticity** that drive learning and attention across development.  

By bridging brain and behavior, my long-term goal is to inform developmental cognitive and educational neuroscience, and to guide the design of interventions that promote adaptive learning and cognitive growth in children.
