Hi there! Thanks for visiting! I'm Ashley Hao, and this site shares my work on learning, attention, and developmental cognitive neurscience :)

## 🎓 Education & Training

I am currently pursuing my M.S. in **Cognitive Psychology** at Vanderbilt University 🐿️ Peabody College, working under the supervision of **Dr. Sophia Vinci-Booher** and **Dr. Gavin Price** to investigate number processing across early childhood.  

Before Vanderbilt, I earned dual B.S. degrees in **Neuroscience** and **Psychology** from Syracuse University 🍊. As an undergraduate, I worked on projects in mindfulness-based interventions, school performance, and stress-related psychophysiology in children and adolescents.

## 🧠 Research Interests

### (1) Developmental trajectories of neuroplasticity
- Age-related changes in functional lateralization, selectivity and white matter supporting learning (letters, numbers) and academic skills (reading, mathematics).
- Longitudinal individual variability in learning-related cortical reorganization  
- Linking neural efficiency and flexibility to cognitive growth and academic outcomes  

### (2) Learning and attention development
- Neural mechanisms of emergence and development of attentional control
- Experience-driven plasticity of frontal-parietal attention networks
- How attentional states modulate learning efficiency during skill acquisition

### (3) Integrating developmental computational and neuroimaging approaches
- Model-based fMRI and MVPA to reveal representational changes during learning
- Developmentally informed machine learning to predict trajectories of learning and attention

## ✨ Broader Goal
Through this work, I aim to uncover **mechanistic principles of neuroplasticity** that drive learning and attention across development.  

By bridging brain and behavior, my long-term goal is to inform developmental cognitive and educational neuroscience, and to guide the design of interventions that promote adaptive learning and cognitive growth in children.
