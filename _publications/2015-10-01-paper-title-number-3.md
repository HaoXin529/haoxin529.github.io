This study applied **random forest regression**, **deep neural networks**, and **structural equation modeling** to examine how mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and rumination contribute to mental health and well-being among 524 college students.  
Machine learning identified *self-transcendence* and *psychological flexibility* as key predictors.  
The SEM further confirmed that flexibility and rumination serially mediated the link between mindfulness and well-being, emphasizing the importance of adaptive self-regulation and reduced cognitive fixation for mental health.
